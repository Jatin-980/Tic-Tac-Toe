# Tic-Tac-Toe
# 🎮 TIC-TAC-TOE in C (Player vs Computer)

A classic CLI-based Tic Tac Toe game built in C, where you play against the computer.  
This is my **first mini project in C**, and it's the result of pure effort, logic, and curiosity — built from scratch without shortcuts.

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Full **Player vs Computer** logic
- ✅ **Input validation** to avoid repeated moves (for both player and computer)
- ✅ Smart **computer move** using random generation + move history check
- ✅ **Win detection** across rows, columns, and diagonals
- ✅ Modular structure with clean, readable functions
- ✅ Console interface with visual feedback

## 🧠 What I’m Proud Of

- Tracked all past inputs for both sides and validated them beautifully
- Wrote the computer’s move logic myself — simple yet felt smart
- Kept everything modular: from input-taking to board printing to win checking
- Avoided shortcuts and made sure the logic was solid and reusable
- Debugged for hours — and enjoyed every bit of it

> 🔁 This isn’t just code — it’s 4+ hours of mindset, learning, trial-and-error, and flow.
